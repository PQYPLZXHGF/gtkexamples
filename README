GtkExamples - Easy to build Gtk examples
========================================

The Gtk documentation gives a lot of examples, but setting up a build
environment for them is a bit tiresome. This project takes care of this.
Moreover, it also has its own, more complex examples. The first 5 examples are
straight from GTK's documentation, but the rest is homebrewed.

How to build
------------

	cd <example folder>
	../waf configure
	../waf
	./build/<executable name>
