GtkTut - Easy to build Gtk tutorials
====================================

The Gtk documentation gives a lot of examples, but setting up a build
environment for them is a bit tiresome. This project takes care of this.

How to build
------------

`cd` into the subfolder corresponding to the project you want to build and
then type the following::

	../waf configure
	../waf

You'll then have an executable in the "build" subfolder.
